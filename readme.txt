 Application for log viewing.
 
 Uses keyboard only.

 system memory. Maximum size of log is near 2 Gb. If file's bigger,
 it will still opens, and accessible persentage of one will be shown at
 the status line (in brackets).

 Tested on Windows XP, 10.

 To open a file with the utility drop it on LogViewer's icon or window.
 Also file can be opened with right mouse click and choice of this application.
 It's may be convenient to mark the checkbox "open with this program" for files
 with ".log" extension.
